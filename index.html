                Terraform - Cloud Infrastructure
              </h3>
              <!-- <hr class="projects__title-text-divider" /> -->

              <p class="text-primary projects__list-item-text-primary">

                  I joined a newly established team consisting of 2 consultants and 3
                  permanent employees. The team‚Äôs purpose was to develop reusable and scalable cloud infrastructure
                  solutions to efficiently serve the organization and its collaborators. The company was structured as a
                  traditional IT organization with separate development and operations departments, each with distinct
                  focuses, work methods, and systems, occasionally posing challenges to cross-departmental
                  collaboration.

                  The technical aspect of the project involved designing and building an Azure cloud infrastructure
                  foundation applicable to all existing and future cloud solutions. The solution adhered to the
                  company‚Äôs platform specifications, combined with Microsoft‚Äôs Hub & Spoke topology model and best
                  practices. The solution was built using Terraform modules, versioned in GIT, and documented in
                  Confluence. Beyond the technical aspect, there was a focus on enhancing transparency and optimizing
                  collaboration between departments.

                  Methods and tools promoting a DevOps culture were implemented to encourage communication and
                  collaboration. Additionally, there was a desire to establish an internal Terraform community for
                  knowledge-sharing, collaborative work, and responsibility for Terraform modules within the company In
                  the initial phase of the project, as a DevOps Engineer, I wrote Terraform code for the Azure cloud
                  infrastructure and utilized my experience in Azure to assist with architectural decisions. Later, as
                  the infrastructure components were completed, I played a hands-on role in the implementation of the
                  first of many new infrastructure projects in Azure. Along the way, I authored documentation,
                  facilitated knowledge-sharing, and presented solution overviews. To optimize collaboration between
                  departments, I established a service catalog with standard request forms and corresponding Standard
                  Operational Procedure descriptions, outlining the services offered, how to request them, and their
                  delivery procedures. To fulfill the goal of creating a Terraform community, I onboarded 2 consultants
                  and 2 permanent members to the community, utilizing pair-programming to build the initial
                  community-owned Terraform modules alongside developers.

                  Our solutions meet the company‚Äôs requirements for functionality, security, and scalability, based on
                  Microsoft‚Äôs Hub & Spoke network topology model with Network Security Groups for micro-segmentation,
                  Azure Firewall for network traffic inspection and filtering, and Web Application Firewall for
                  protecting web services against OWASP vulnerabilities. The solution has been implemented and deployed
                  in several projects in Sweden, America, and Canada, with two new deployments underway in Holland and
                  Singapore. Implementation times for new regions have gradually decreased from months to weeks and now
                  to days.
                  Collaboration between departments has improved as information has become easily accessible and
                  processes are well-documented. The community effort has created awareness of the department‚Äôs
                  existence and purpose while contributing to the development and maintenance of Terraform modules.

                  I was engaged to architect and deploy Azure infrastructure components utilizing Terraform to
                  facilitate API integrations for an energy project. This assignment entailed constructing a robust
                  foundation to support seamless communication and data exchange across various systems and
                  stakeholders. The project required expertise in Azure services such as Azure API Management, App
                  Service, Docker, Azure Container Registry, Azure Key Vault, Storage Account, and Service Bus.

                  The primary task involved designing and implementing Azure infrastructure components to enable
                  efficient API integrations within the energy project. This encompassed provisioning resources such as
                  Azure API Management for API governance and lifecycle management, App Service for hosting APIs, Docker
                  for containerization, Azure Container Registry for storing Docker images, Azure Key Vault for secure
                  key management, Storage Account for data storage, and Service Bus for reliable message queuing and
                  communication.

                  In this assignment, my role was to lead the deployment of Azure infrastructure components using
                  Terraform, in close collaboration with the project team. Leveraging Terraform's infrastructure as code
                  capabilities, I developed reusable templates to provision and configure Azure resources consistently.
                  Working closely with stakeholders, I conducted thorough assessments to determine the optimal
                  configuration for each component, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security. Integration with
                  Azure Key Vault enhanced security by securely storing and managing sensitive information such as API
                  keys and certificates. Additionally, Storage Account and Service Bus were utilized to facilitate data
                  storage, messaging, and communication between different components of the system.

                  The deployment of Azure infrastructure components using Terraform enabled seamless API integrations
                  within the energy project, resulting in improved operational efficiency and collaboration. By
                  leveraging Azure services such as API Management, App Service, Docker, and others, the project team
                  achieved greater agility and scalability in delivering API-driven solutions. The secure and reliable
                  communication facilitated by components like Azure Key Vault and Service Bus ensured the
                  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and services.

                  focusing on utilizing various tools and methodologies to ensure efficiency, security, and reliability.

                  My responsibility was to establish a robust Azure Infrastructure Supply Chain. This encompassed
                  utilizing DevOps Boards for work item tracking and Git version control for code management.
                  Additionally, infrastructure was defined as code using Terraform, while YAML pipelines were
                  constructed to include code validation and security vulnerability scanning. Furthermore, maintaining a
                  Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline was vital for the project's success.

                  In collaboration with the team, I contributed to the establishment of the Azure Infrastructure Supply
                  Chain. This involved building YAML pipelines with thorough code validation and security checks.
                  Additionally, I played a key role in crafting Terraform scripts for deploying Azure resources and
                  ensuring consistency across environments. Furthermore, I provided assistance as a security advisor to
                  business integration partners, leveraging tools like Checkov and Microsoft Defender for Cloud for
                  automated design and code review to validate security posture before and after deployments.
                  Documentation writing was also a significant part of my responsibilities.

                  Our efforts led to the successful establishment of a secure and modern Azure Infrastructure Supply
                  Chain. By utilizing DevOps practices, Git version control, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and
                  robust CI/CD pipelines, we achieved a streamlined and secure deployment process. Moreover, our
                  proactive approach to security, including automated design and code review, contributed to enhancing
                  the overall security posture of the cloud solutions.

                  I was brought on board to assist developers, security, and IT operations staff in designing and
                  implementing an API management system. This involved utilizing Azure API Management and Web
                  Application Firewall to establish a robust framework.

                  Developing an API management system required ensuring seamless communication between different systems
                  while prioritizing security and efficiency. This involved deploying infrastructure and APIs using GIT
                  and CI/CD pipelines for source code version control and deployment.

                  My role involved collaborating closely with team members utilizing Kanban boards to streamline our
                  workflow. Together, we built CI/CD pipelines enabling configuration as code and version control,
                  ensuring consistency and ease of management. I also took the lead in writing infrastructure as code
                  using Terraform, ensuring scalability and reproducibility.

                  Through our efforts, we successfully implemented an API management system that met the project's
                  objectives. The platform facilitated seamless communication between systems while incorporating robust
                  security measures. Our use of GIT, CI/CD pipelines, and Terraform contributed to efficient development
                  and deployment processes, ultimately enhancing the organization's capabilities.
