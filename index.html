        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Cloud Architect and DevOps engineer with over 10 years of experience. During my career, I have designed and built a wide range of cloud solutions, from greenfield landing-zones to enterprise-scale migration projects. I am devoted to using methods and technologies to secure and improve software delivery supply chain. I am excited about the opportunities that AI and Cloud Native provides for enhanced productivity ðŸš€, developer experience ðŸ¤©, and product delivery ðŸŽ¯, and I am eager to help others make the most of these powerful tools.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am also a dedicated learner with a strong commitment to continuous improvement. I am always looking for new ways to grow and develop my skills, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others.</p>
        <p>I seamlessly transition between onsite and remote environments, employing tailored strategies to maximize productivity and collaboration in each setting. Onsite, I leverage face-to-face interactions with stakeholders, conduct workshops, and troubleshoot issues in real-time. Remote work is facilitated through robust communication channels, virtual collaboration tools, and structured online meetings, ensuring seamless coordination with distributed teams and timely delivery of services.</p>
