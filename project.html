                                I joined a newly established team consisting of 2 consultants and 3
                                permanent employees. The team‚Äôs purpose was to develop reusable and scalable cloud
                                infrastructure
                                solutions to efficiently serve the organization and its collaborators. The company was
                                structured as a
                                traditional IT organization with separate development and operations departments, each
                                with distinct
                                focuses, work methods, and systems, occasionally posing challenges to cross-departmental
                                collaboration.

                                The technical aspect of the project involved designing and building an Azure cloud
                                infrastructure
                                foundation applicable to all existing and future cloud solutions. The solution adhered
                                to the
                                company‚Äôs platform specifications, combined with Microsoft‚Äôs Hub & Spoke topology model
                                and best
                                practices. The solution was built using Terraform modules, versioned in GIT, and
                                documented in
                                Confluence. Beyond the technical aspect, there was a focus on enhancing transparency and
                                optimizing
                                collaboration between departments.

                                Methods and tools promoting a DevOps culture were implemented to encourage communication
                                and
                                collaboration. Additionally, there was a desire to establish an internal Terraform
                                community for
                                knowledge-sharing, collaborative work, and responsibility for Terraform modules within
                                the company In
                                the initial phase of the project, as a DevOps Engineer, I wrote Terraform code for the
                                Azure cloud
                                infrastructure and utilized my experience in Azure to assist with architectural
                                decisions. Later, as
                                the infrastructure components were completed, I played a hands-on role in the
                                implementation of the
                                first of many new infrastructure projects in Azure. Along the way, I authored
                                documentation,
                                facilitated knowledge-sharing, and presented solution overviews. To optimize
                                collaboration between
                                departments, I established a service catalog with standard request forms and
                                corresponding Standard
                                Operational Procedure descriptions, outlining the services offered, how to request them,
                                and their
                                delivery procedures. To fulfill the goal of creating a Terraform community, I onboarded
                                2 consultants
                                and 2 permanent members to the community, utilizing pair-programming to build the
                                initial
                                community-owned Terraform modules alongside developers.

                                Our solutions meet the company‚Äôs requirements for functionality, security, and
                                scalability, based on
                                Microsoft‚Äôs Hub & Spoke network topology model with Network Security Groups for
                                micro-segmentation,
                                Azure Firewall for network traffic inspection and filtering, and Web Application
                                Firewall for
                                protecting web services against OWASP vulnerabilities. The solution has been implemented
                                and deployed
                                in several projects in Sweden, America, and Canada, with two new deployments underway in
                                Holland and
                                Singapore. Implementation times for new regions have gradually decreased from months to
                                weeks and now
                                to days.
                                Collaboration between departments has improved as information has become easily
                                accessible and
                                processes are well-documented. The community effort has created awareness of the
                                department‚Äôs
                                existence and purpose while contributing to the development and maintenance of Terraform
                                modules.

                                Our efforts led to the successful establishment of a secure and modern Azure
                                Infrastructure Supply
                                Chain. By utilizing DevOps practices, Git version control, Terraform for infrastructure
                                as code, and
                                robust CI/CD pipelines, we achieved a streamlined and secure deployment process.
                                Moreover, our
                                proactive approach to security, including automated design and code review, contributed
                                to enhancing
                                the overall security posture of the cloud solutions.

                                control,
                                ensuring consistency and ease of management. I also took the lead in writing
                                infrastructure as code
                                using Terraform, ensuring scalability and reproducibility.
